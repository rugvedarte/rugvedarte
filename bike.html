			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This project was made as a part of the Maker's Asylum rapid prototyping course. The project was developed as a prototype with scope for future developments. It makes use of prototyping tools and methods such as Sketching, 3D printing, Laser Cutting, Arduinos and woodworking.
			</p>

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>
				Bike riders who go on long trips face problems related to wear and tear of the bicycles. The air pressure in the bicycle tire reduces after prolonged use. Sometimes the bicycle tire gets a puncture and the air pressure reduces gradually without noticeable effects. These times can be fairly dangerous if the problem is ignored.
			</p>
			<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
			<p>
				We designed a portable air pressure sensor which could go directly on the tires and give real-time updates on the handlebar. An air piston can be attached under the seat which could be used to fill the air when low pressure is observed. A future modification can also include variation in air pressure for traction control.
			</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<div>

				<p>
					<h5>Brainstorming</h5>
					<p>
						We followed the <b>Double Diamond design thinking method (Diverge – Converge – Diverge - Converge)</b> to generate different ideas. After serious brainstorming, we had 12 problems on the idea board to choose from, amongst which our team chose the Bicycle.
					</p>
					<div class="image-full"><img src="images/rp/rp3.png" alt=""></div>
					<p>
						We planned to tackle the air pressure problem which many of the users had faced. We started off from exploring various options and looked at other examples but none of the devices offered a real-time update to the rider.
						Our main target users were the long distance cyclists who do not carry pumps with them and are often ride in deserted areas.
					</p>
					<p>
						We started sketching different ideas and for the problem and after a few iterations we reached a conclusion to build a device which would fit on the tire and give real-time updates to the user with a small monitor on the handlebar.
					</p>
				</p>


				<p>
					<h5>Product Sketch</h5>
					<p>
						We wanted the product to be compact and robust to bear with the heavy physical moment of the bicycle. It needed to be compact so that it would fit on the wheel without disturbing the mechanism.
					</p>
					<p>
						We tried various designs and positions for our device. And settled with a rough blueprint.
						We assembled the parts required for the Air pressure sensor and started designed a part which would connect the tube, device and the air pump.
					</p>
					<div class="image-full"><img src="images/rp/rp1.png" alt=""></div>
					<p>
						As such a part wasn’t available, we 3D printed the part which looked like a T. This would enable us to use the airpump while the sensor is connected to the tire.
					</p>
				</p>



				<p>
					<h5>Components</h5>
					<p>
						<b>1. Arduino</b><br>
						Two Arduinos are used to build the system:
						<br>
						a)	Arduino Nano is programmed to read the air sensor readings and through RF transmit to bicycle handle.<br>
						b)	This transmitted data is received by RF Receiver with Arduino and display desired values on display on bicycle handle.
						<br>
						Operational Amplifier (Op Amp) is used with Arduino to amplify the voltage. LM-358 Op Amp is used.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>2. RF Module</b><br>
						ASK 434 MHz is used for transmitting and receiving the sensed air pressures.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>3. Battery</b><br>
						A transistor battery is used to power both Arduinos. This 9V supply is reduced with regulator.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>4. Air Pressure Sensor</b><br>
						VS76- 700 KPA Air Pressure Sensor is used to sense the air pressure in the bicycle tire.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>5. Display</b><br>
						OLED 0.96 Inch display mounted on bicycle handle shows the pressure readings.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>6. Regulator</b><br>
						LM 7805 Voltage Regulator is used to regulate the 9V transistor battery supply to make it suitable for 5V sensor, Arduino and other devices.
					</p>


				</p>

				<p>
					<h5>Workflow</h5>
					<div class="image-full"><img src="images/rp/rp2.png" alt=""></div>
					<br>
					Air pressure sensor senses the tire pressure and signals the Arduino about the output. The Arduino is connected with RF Module which transmits the air pressure reading to the display mounted on the bicycle handle and also alarms if the pressure reaches below a certain limit.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h5>Limitations</h5>
					The air pressure sensor needs to be adaptable for different valve sizes. The original circuit is bigger in size which may act as a hurdle for implementing it on the tire. The circuit also needs to be stronger to sustain during high mobility and vibrations of the bicycle.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h5>Future Applications</h5>
					The sensor can be used to provide traction control by changing the air pressure level for different types of terrains.
