				Our client was an event planning software company which provided a platform for event planners for resource planning and intra-team communication and the communication between the team and attendees, speakers and all other people related to the project. It helped organizers monitor event planning progress, manage registrations, post agendas and analyze data after the event.

			<h3 class="mb-1">The Problem</h3>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Customer service was a strong part of our client business. They interacted with their clients addressed their problems daily. The customer service executives would provide live support to the customers through a live chat feature on the portal. As the customers grew, the queries increased eventually increasing the load on the team. The client created a knowledge base containing all the frequently answered questions (FAQs) which would help the customers and reduce the queries for the customer service team. The customers did not use the FAQ page and the load did not reduce. It was essential for the client team to reduce the load on the team and still maintain the customer satisfaction level. Our team's objective was to find a way to promote the use of FAQ pages and reduce the load on the client team answering questions through the chat feature.
			</p>

			<h3 class="mb-1">Process</h3>
			<div class="pb-4">
