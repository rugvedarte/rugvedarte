			<p class="pb-4">
				Our client was a website that connected athletes and teams across the globe. It aimed to provide athletes with opportunities to play abroad and the teams to fill up their rosters. The website also provided a social platform for athletes to share information and connect to each other. The website was mainly focused on field hockey players but aimed to grow into other sports as well.
			</p>

			<h3 class="mb-1">The Problem</h3>
			<p class="pb-4">
				We were assigned to improve the usability of the Search Feature and the Profile Page representing the athlete.

			<h3 class="mb-1">Process</h3>
			<div class="pb-4">
				Time Frame: <b>2 months</b>
				<img src="" alt="">
				<h5>Scoping of the Project</h5>
				<p>
					An initial client meeting was conducted and the product was scoped. We were assigned to work on the Search and User Profile sections of the website.
				</p>
				<h5>Stakeholder Analysis</h5>
				<p>
				We conducted a stakeholder analysis before moving on the website and identified all the major stakeholders in the website.
				</p>

				<h5>Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
				<p>
					As the website was already live, we started by identifying major problem areas in the two assigned features. We conducted a heuristic evaluation and a competitive analysis for the website. The filters and the edit profile page were identified as the main flawed areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Results obtained - Interaction Map, Major problem areas of the website.
				</p>

				<h5>Comparative Analysis(Feature Wise)</h5>
				<p>
					It was found that there was no direct competitor to the website thus we conducted a feature comparative analysis with websites having similar goals and design.
				</p>
				<p>
					Result:<b> Feature-wise comparative analysis and other models.</b>
				</p>

				<h5>Sketching</h5>
				<p>
					We sketched our ideas based on different features obtained from the comaparative analysis. I was responsible for sketching the Search feature. My sketch was inspired by effective use of filters on various websites with similar goals. These filters were organized and represented to minimize the number of clicks for a user using the search function.
				</p>
				<p>
					Result: <b>Rouch laypout sketches for Search and Profile Page</b>
				</p>

				<h5>User Recruitment</h5>
				<p>
					Users recruited were students looking to play professionally with an inclination to playing abroad. They included field hockey players and athletes in general who were into playing sports professionally.
				</p>

				<h5>Usability Testing and Paper Prototype</h5>
				<p>
					We constructed a paper prototype using the information given by the clients and the results of the comparative analysis. As the project had a shorter deadline, we modified the traditional design process and conducted user interviews and usability test on the constructed paper prototype. Major flaws within the website were revealed during this test and it also gave us major insights into using filters for
				</p>
				<p>
					Result:<b>Paper Prototype and Design Critique</b>
				</p>



				<h5>Hi-Fi Prototype</h5>
				<p>
					 We designed a high fidelity prototype from the wireframes created during the low-fi prototyping and paper prototyping. Modifications were made while building the Hi-Fi prototype cosidering the feedback from the paper prototype. A style guide was created to help the client to maintain consistency in future designs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Results: <b>Hi-Fi prototype and Style Guide</b>
				</p>

				<h5>Final Deliverables</h5>
				<p>
					Then, we conducted usability tests again on the Hi-fi prototype to validate our design decisions and the final search and profile pages were provided to the client as the final deliverable.
