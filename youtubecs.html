							<h3>Client Summary</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								<span style="font-size:1.5em"><b>YouTube Creator Studio</b></span> is a sub-product of the online video platform, YouTube, that enables users, also known as “creators”, create and share content as well as manage their channels. Users in this context are referred to as “creators”. Creators can utilize different tools in the Creator Studio to organize their channel, manage videos, and interact with fans.
							</p>

							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>
								We wanted to understand how users interact with Creator Studio and their motivations towards creating content.
							</p>

							<h3>Target Audience</h3>
							<p>
								Our target audience was content creators between the age of <span class="emphasis">18-30</span> which was further categorized as <span class="emphasis">Novice Creators</span> (&lt;1k subscribers) and <span class="emphasis">Emerging Creators</span> (1k - 100k subscribers).
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>We conducted the research in 2 major phases and 6 research methods.<br>
								1. Needs Assessment
								2. Product Evaluation
							</p>

							<div>
								<div class="image-full"><img class="med" src="images/youtube/ycs1.png" alt=""></div>
								<h3>1. System Overview - Interaction Map</h3>
								<p>
									We created an interaction map to get an overview of the product and understand the functionality. The interaction map led us to discover the current system interactions with Creator Studio Classic and Creator Studio Beta and how both the versions are still linked to each other.
								</p>
								<div class="image-full"><img class="small" src="images/youtube/ycs2.png" alt=""></div>

								<h3>2. User Interviews</h3>
								<p>
									We conducted 7 user interviews with 3 novice users and 4 emerging creators. The goals of the interviews were to understand creators’ habits as well as the perceived limitations of the product. The interviews lasted 35-70 mins anwas followed by interpretation sessions and affinity diagramming.
								</p>
								<div style="margin:0.5em 0em 2em 0em;">
									Key Findings from the interviews:
									<ol class="findings">
										<li style="font-weight:700">
											Users have variety of motivations to create content which includes empathethic sharing, engagement and fostering a sense of community.
										</li>
										<li style="font-weight:700">
											Youtube was insufficient in providing tools for collaboration and engagement.
										</li>
										<li style="font-weight:700">
											Users used other platforms to create more meaningful relationships with their viewers.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</div>



								<h3>3. Comparative Analysis</h3>
								<p>
									Gathering insights from the interviews, we conducted a comparative analysis considering 7 competitors from 5 different categories to understand the market scenario. We judged the competitors based on types of content shared and the tools provided. We created a feature matrix to compare different competitors and reach the conclusion.
								</p>
								<p>
									<div class="image-full"><img class="small" src="images/youtube/ycs3.png" alt=""></div>

									<br>
									<span style="font-weight:700">
										We found that youtube lied in the middle of the content creation - social ecosystem. It provided less flexibility than its competitors as a content creator platform or a social platform.
									</span>
								</p>
								<br>



								<h3>4. Surveys</h3>
								<div style="margin-bottom:2em">
									We conducted 2 surveys to understand how Creators collaborate and coordinate co-creation and what platforms and tools do creators use to collaborate on.
									<ol style="margin:0.5em 0em 0.5em 1em">
										<li style="font-weight:700"><span style="color:#C1272D; font-size:1.2em;">30</span> valid responses over 7 days</li>
										<li style="font-weight:700"><span style="color:#C1272D; font-size:1.2em;">250</span> valid responses over 3 days</li>
									</ol>
									The responses from the surveys validated our findings from the interviews. We found that 79% of creators who do not collaborate attribute this to the difficulty of initiating collaboration. Also, content creators and used other applications to reach out to viewers and other creators.
									<div class="image-full"><img src="images/youtube/ycs6.png" alt=""></div>
									<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:700;">
										<span class="emphasis">50%</span> participants felt collaboration is difficult on youtube and <span class="emphasis">86%</span> wanted to collaborate.
									</p>
								</div>
								<br>


								<h3>5. Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
								<p>
									We conducted a total of <span class="emphasis">5 heuristic evaluations</span>, where each member of our team tested the Beta version based on Nielsen’s 10 heuristics measurements and rated them to identify potential usability issues.
									<br>
									<div class="image-full"><img class="med" src="images/youtube/ycs7.png" alt=""></div>
									<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:700;">
										<span class="emphasis">Navigation, Metaphor and Feedback</span> received the most severity ratings making them as major areas of usability issues.
									</p>


								</p>
								<br>

								<h3>6. Usability Tests</h3>
								<p>
									We conducted <span class="emphasis">5 usability tests</span> by recruiting participants from two groups: novice creators, users who were not very familiar with the platform but had uploaded videos in the past, and experienced creators, user who have a lot of experience using Creator Studio classic version. All participants were between the ages of 19-30.
								</p>
								<p>
	 								Our goal for the usability test was to create a deeper understanding of usability problems users may face. We centered the tasks around issues that were uncovered through the heuristic evaluation.
								</p>
								The following were the findings and recommendations from the Usability tests,
